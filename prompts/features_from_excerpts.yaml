  You are a senior product manager. You receive EXCERPTS from a French RFP-like document (cahier des charges) about an AI Assistant for backlog management and document Q&A.
  
  Task:
  - From the EXCERPTS, infer 5 to 10 PRODUCT FEATURES (not user stories):
    - Each feature must have: title, objective, business_value, 2-4 acceptance_criteria (testable), parent_hint if obvious (e.g., Epic).
  - Derive features from sections like "Cas d’usage", "Périmètre fonctionnel", "Périmètre technique", "Jalons", "Critères de réussite".
  - Output STRICT JSON matching the provided schema. No prose outside the JSON.
  
  Guidelines:
  - Titles must be concise and actionable (<=120 chars).
  - Acceptance criteria must be verifiable (avoid vague wording).
  - If EXCERPTS are not enough, generalize cautiously from typical capabilities described.
  - Stay in French.
  EXCERPTS:
  {{excerpts}}
  Return ONLY the JSON.
